🦁 Zoo Management System

📘 Overview

The Zoo Management System is a Java application designed to help manage animals, staff, and operations within a zoo. It provides an easy-to-use interface for adding, updating, and deleting records while applying solid Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This project simulates real-world management tasks such as tracking animals, verifying zoo capacity, and managing personnel — making it a valuable educational project for learning Java and OOP concepts.
